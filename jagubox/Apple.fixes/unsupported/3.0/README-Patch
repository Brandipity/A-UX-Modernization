The file Patch.tar.gz includes drop-in replacements for the Patch.0178
and Patch.067C files found in /mac/lib/Patches. These replacements are
designed to fix the problem in A/UX 3.0 with the A/UX-MacOS System heap
expansion capability which prevents you from loading several memory-hungry
Extensions and cdevs (such as ATM, SuitCase, AfterCard, etc...). It also
contains a replacement for macgetty which increases the amount of VM
allocated for the Login screen.

To install, copy the Patch.???? files to /mac/lib/Patches. Copy the file
'macgetty' to /etc. Please be sure to backup the older versions of
Patch.???? and macgetty first. Then log out and log back in.

!!! *** DO NOT INSTALL THESE UNDER A/UX 3.0.1 *** !!!
