Here are the diffs to get gcc 2.6.3 to compile and run under A/UX. To upgrade
to gcc 2.6.3 you'll need to use gcc to compile gcc. To do this, grab a
pre-compiled version of gcc and install it. When you've done that, you're
ready to recreate gcc.

First of all, you'll need to grab the source for gcc 2.6.3 from your
favorite site. Then apply the A/UX-patches:

	% patch < Ngcc4aux.diffs

At this point, copy 'gas' (from the gcc distribution) over to the source
directory for gcc 2.6.3 as 'as'. This is an important step; don't forget it.

Finally, type:

	% ./configure aux

At this point, look through Makefile and make sure things are located where
you will want them to go. By default, gcc will expect to be placed in
/usr/local/Gnu and all it's supplemental files, such as cc1, to be located
in /usr/local/Gnu/lib/gcc/aux/2.6.3. Once you've done this, you are ready
to start building gcc. Type:

	% make CC=<<gcc>>

where <<gcc>> is the full pathname to your "old" copy of gcc... and wait.

When that's done, you will want to (well,... I recommend it, at least :) )
make a stage2 build. This is done by typing:

	% make stage1
	% ln as stage1/as
	% make CC="stage1/xgcc -Bstage1/"

Wait for this to complete... When this is done, you can either continue to
build a stage3 compiler, or install gcc. To make the stage3 compiler:

	% make stage2
	% ln as stage2/as
	% make CC="stage2/xgcc -Bstage2/"

Then finally type:

	% make CC="stage2/xgcc -Bstage2/" compare

At long last, you are ready to install 2.6.3... This is accomplished by
typing, easily enough:

	% make CC="stage2/xgcc -Bstage2/" install

To make and install the Objective C stuff; do:

	% make CC="stage2/xgcc -Bstage2/" objc-runtime
	% make CC="stage2/xgcc -Bstage2/" install-libobjc

Finally, do:

	% chmod 755 fixcrts
	% ./fixcrts

The diffs are _heavily_ based on those provided by John Coolidge @ Apple
for gcc 2.5.7... John's been busy with work (and getting married :) ) so
I've made these diffs available until John can re-take-over the gcc stuff.

Enjoy!
